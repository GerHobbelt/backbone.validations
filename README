This is a work in progress.

TODO:
- Put the validation pipeline in the Model's prototype, rather than on every model. This will be much nicer. > . <
- Write validations
- Add the ability to easily add custom validations

Something like this would be cool:
  Backbone.Validations.addValidatorType("validationName", function() { ... } );
